# Prototype Macro Model App
Django deployed on Heroku with MariaDB.
Macro modelling tool based on R-Excel legacy tool to scale and implement automatic modelling filters.
Models were built with ARIMAs from independent variables (from excels with macro variables such as GDP, unemployment, ...) to observed Probabilities of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD)

Development stopped after I changed to a different department, this was during my personal free time
